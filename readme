This is the AlexandriaLog project repository

This is a simple django task-manager project for local database managment
of task with CRUD functionalities. It has customized models and functions
for the managment of tasks within my personal workflow working with several
molecular calculations but, in principle, may be useful for others.

This project is still in its first stages, fields and functinalities may 
be added as I start considering them useful for my workflow. 
Thanks for lurking.
